# Mitigation App

## Overview
The **Mitigation App** is a Shiny dashboard application designed to help users optimize environmental mitigation projects efficiently. It allows users to select one or more projects, compute optimal solutions and costs, view intermediate results, and export outputs for reporting.

This app is built using **R**, **Shiny**, and **shinydashboard**, with a focus on clarity, usability, and clean UI structure.
